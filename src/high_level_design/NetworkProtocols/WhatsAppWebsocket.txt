Note:
1. Only WhatsApp Web uses WebSockets, while phone-to-phone message transfer does not use WebSockets.
2. WhatsApp Web(The Browser version of WhatsApp) uses Websockets to maintain a realtime connection between your phone
  and the webclient.

How WhatsApp uses Websockets?
1. Establishing Connection:
  When you scan the QR code, WhatsApp Web sends an HTTP request to establish a WebSocket connection with WhatsApp servers.
  The connection remains persistent, meaning your phone and browser can exchange messages in real-time.

2. Message Synchronization:
  When a new message is received on your phone, the WhatsApp server pushes it to WhatsApp Web without requiring a new request.
  If you send a message from WhatsApp Web, it's sent instantly via WebSockets.

3. Delivery & Read Receipts:
  As soon as the recipient reads your message, a real-time update is sent back to your
  WebSocket connection, updating the double blue ticks instantly.

4. Connection and Loss of Connection:
  If your phone disconnects from the internet, the WebSocket connection breaks, and WhatsApp Web shows “Phone not connected”.
  When your phone reconnects, the WebSocket session is re-established automatically.
