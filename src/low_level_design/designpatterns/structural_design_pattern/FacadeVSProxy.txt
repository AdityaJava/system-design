CLient  -> Facace -> ActualObject

Client -> Proxy  -> ActualObject


Though above seems as same but
1. Facade takes care of multiple objects for a client like Employee, Student etc

2. Proxy of the object will be of same type as of original object and will not handle other objects proxies

Like EmployeeProxy will not handle methods for StudentProxy but

PaymentFacade can have both  objects
