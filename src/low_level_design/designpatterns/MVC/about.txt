1. This is generally an architecture rather than a design pattern.
2. Spring boot follows MVC


//MVC

View
1. View is frontend repo

Controller
1. Controller is backend repo and contains all business logic in it

Mode
1. Model is separate repo for entities where CRUD operations for entities are done
2. This repo  have RestController which exposes endpoints for CRUD operations on entities


This architecture is generally used when the app is huge and not recommended for large apps
