It can happen that 2 user might book same seat so we need concurrency handling here.
There are 2 ways of handling it

1. Pesimistic
2. Optimistic

1. Pesimistic
   a. Lock while we read and only release when user updates it
   b. Other users will fail to read it

2. Optimistic
   a. It creates version of the object
   b. It checks the version of the object at the time of update and puts the lock here if it is same means no one has updated it
   c. If the version is changed it means that someone has changed it and need to read again.
