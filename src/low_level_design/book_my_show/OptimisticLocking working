How Optimistic Locking Works
Optimistic locking relies on detecting conflicts when data is being updated, rather than preventing conflicts beforehand.
This is achieved by using a version field or a similar mechanism in the database record.
Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. Setting Up the Version Field
A special column, typically named version, is added to the table.
This column holds a numeric value or timestamp that indicates the version of the record.
For example, a table might look like this:

ID	Name	Price	Version
1	Product A	100	1
2. Reading Data
A transaction reads the data from the database, including the version field.
For example:

java
Copy code
Product product = productRepository.findById(1L).orElseThrow();
System.out.println(product.getVersion()); // Output: 1
3. Making Changes
The transaction makes changes to the data locally.
java
Copy code
product.setPrice(120); // Modify the price
4. Writing Back Changes
When the transaction tries to save the changes, Hibernate generates an UPDATE statement that includes a condition checking the version.
Generated SQL:

sql
Copy code
UPDATE product
SET name = 'Product A', price = 120, version = version + 1
WHERE id = 1 AND version = 1;
Key points:

The version = 1 in the WHERE clause ensures that no one else has updated the record since it was read.
5. Conflict Detection
If no other transaction has modified the record, the version in the database matches the condition (version = 1), and the update succeeds.
 The version field in the database is incremented to 2.
ID	Name	Price	Version
1	Product A	120	2
If another transaction has already modified the record and incremented the version, the WHERE condition fails (version != 1), and no rows are updated. Hibernate throws an OptimisticLockException.
Conflict Example
Transaction A reads:
ID = 1, Name = Product A, Price = 100, Version = 1.
Transaction B reads:
ID = 1, Name = Product A, Price = 100, Version = 1.
Transaction B updates the record:
sql
Copy code
UPDATE product
SET price = 110, version = version + 1
WHERE id = 1 AND version = 1;
The record is updated, and the version becomes 2.
Transaction A tries to update the same record:
sql
Copy code
UPDATE product
SET price = 120, version = version + 1
WHERE id = 1 AND version = 1;
No rows are updated because version = 1 is no longer true.
Hibernate throws an OptimisticLockException.
Retry Logic
When an OptimisticLockException occurs, you can implement retry logic to re-read the data and attempt the operation again.

Example:

java
Copy code
public void updateProduct(Long id, String newName) {
    int retries = 3;
    while (retries > 0) {
        try {
            Product product = productRepository.findById(id).orElseThrow();
            product.setName(newName);
            productRepository.save(product);
            break; // Exit loop if successful
        } catch (OptimisticLockException e) {
            retries--;
            if (retries == 0) throw e; // Re-throw if no retries left
        }
    }
}
Advantages
Scalability: No database-level locks; suitable for high-concurrency applications.
Efficiency: Locking is deferred until the commit phase, reducing contention.
Disadvantages
Retry Overhead: Requires retry logic in case of contention.
Not Immediate: Conflicts are detected at the end of the transaction, not when the data is first read.
